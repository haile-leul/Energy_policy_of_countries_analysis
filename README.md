# Energy Policy of Countries Analysis Using K-means

[See Project Full Report](https://github.com/haile-leul/Energy_policy_of_countries_analysis/blob/main/Report_Mining_of_Large_Dataset.pdf)

This project uses energy indicators dataset of countries for 25 years and studies the energy policy of countries.

The porject shows usage of big data to answer critical questions. It shows data pre-processing and utilization of k-means algorithm to cluster countries with similar energy policies for electricity generation.
